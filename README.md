# Game Description 
We will implement a 2-Dimensions skill-based game called Tetfit. The game's main inspiration is Tetris game. Tetfit is a single player game that can be played on PC for Windows. It will be implemented in Java language.
The game will be composed of unit squares which come together to become letters  I, J, L, O, S, T and Z. In the beginning, player starts with an empty screen and begins to fill the screen with the letters falling from the top of the screen. When the squares at the bottom of the game screen compose a full horizontal line; the line will disappear, upper boxes will fall down and the player's score will be incremented. The goal of the game is to score as high as possible. The game will end when a unit square hits the top of the screen.
Moreover, there is also a mod called "Arcade Mode" which keeps the same idea; however, the game is time limited. While the game counting downwards, player should make full horizontal line as much as possible to extend the time back. The purpose is to get as much point as can before time hits 00:00 .
